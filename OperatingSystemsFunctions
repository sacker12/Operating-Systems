One of the main operating system functions is to manage the computers memory.  This would be the internal memory of the computer, also known as RAM (random access memory).  The task of memory management is to ensure that the processes performed by the computer are able to access adequate memory to function.
Another operating system function is called booting.  Booting is the process the computer goes through to start up.  It checks the system to make sure it's prepared to run properly.
The operating system function that protects your operating system and the data stored on it is known as data security.  This operating system is critical to protect against viruses and unwanted intrusions into your system.  There are people that make a living by stealing data.  Having the right protections in place can save you a lot of time, trouble and expense.
